The goal of `RRmorph` is to provide tools to map evolutionary rate and patterns directly on three-dimensional shapes.
The main computational functions of this package are `rate.map` and `conv.map`, which are still also available as a part of the [`RRphylo`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RRphylo) R package (where they were first published). The reason we decided to move these functions in a brand new package is that we made some heavy changes to both of them and, in doing so, produced some additional tools we think might be useful to everyone deals with 3d meshes and surfaces. In `RRmorph`, `rate.map` and `conv.map` are able to plot evolutionary rates/convergence patterns on real 3d surfaces. This is done by means of a new function, `interpolMesh`, which transfers values related to the reconstructed meshes (the output of `RRphylo::rate.map` and `RRphylo::conv.map`) to the real 3D surfaces they were derived from.
